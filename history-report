##One-liner that parses a text file created called "yum_history_temp.txt" for package update history.
##THIS IS SPECIFIC TO VM's THAT HAVE AUTO-UPDATES ENABLED
##
##First get the update history for all packages and output that to a text file we can parse. We could just send this to standard out, however we'll clean this
##up at the end of the script
##
#yum history package-list '*' > /home/fhadmin/yum_history_temp.txt
##
##Then we need to parse the file specifically for the "fhadmin" string, and output a format that is readable
##
#cat /home/fhadmin/yum_history_temp.txt | grep $(yum history list | grep fhadmin | head -n 1 | awk '{print$1}')" |" > /home/fhadmin/test.txt
##
##Now clean up the text file created in the first step
##
#rm /home/fhadmin/yum_history_temp.txt
##
##The above can be run as a one-liner like so: 
#
#yum history package-list '*' > /home/fhadmin/yum_history_temp.txt;cat /home/fhadmin/yum_history_temp.txt | grep $(yum history list | grep fhadmin | head -n 1 | awk '{print$1}')" |" > /home/fhadmin/test.txt; rm /home/fhadmin/yum_history_temp.txt
